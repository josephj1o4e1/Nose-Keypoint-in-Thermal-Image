Here the main file is train_nosedetection.py
Please specify the dataset root path argument. 
The command line should be like: python train_nosedetection.py --datasetroot "path to dataset"
The dataset should be constructed as an "Input" folder and "Target" folder, which they are image.png-target.json pairs for supervised learning.
